# API Contract Enforcement Rule

Whenever you implement or update any frontend code that interacts with the backend API:

- **ALWAYS reference `docs/api_docs.md` for every API call.**
- **Verify:**
  - The endpoint URL and HTTP method match the documentation.
  - The request payload (body, query params, headers) matches the documented schema.
  - The response structure matches the documentation.
  - The status codes and error payloads are handled as described.
  - Authentication requirements are respected as documented.

If any discrepancy is found between the frontend code and `api_docs.md`:
- Pause implementation and resolve the mismatch.
- Update the frontend to match the documentation, or update `api_docs.md` (and backend, if needed) if the documentation is out of date.

**No API call should be implemented, changed, or merged unless it is fully aligned with the latest `docs/api_docs.md` for URL, payload, response, and status codes.**
